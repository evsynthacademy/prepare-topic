##   Managing conflict of interest


### Manage conflict of interest


Before you move forward with your team, it’s important to make sure no one has a clear interest in swaying the results of your systematic review. <br><br>

That’s why you need to ask all of your team members to disclose their potential conflicts of interest. <br><br>

Conflicts of interest can be financial: would your team members or their close relatives earn or lose money as a result of your systematic review? Are any of your team members receiving funding from a company that would benefit from the results of your review?
<br><br>
Conflicts of interest can also be intellectual: Do any of your team members have strongly held beliefs about a topic that will be addressed in your systematic review? <br><br>
If someone has a very clear conflict of interest, you’ll have to exclude them from your team. If the conflict is less clear, just find ways to manage and document that potential conflict. 
<br><br>

### Stakeholder conflict of interest

Of course, these standards are slightly different for the stakeholders and experts you consult. By their very nature, these people have a personal interest in the results of your review. To counteract these unavoidable conflicts of interest, be sure to solicit a broad range of perspectives. <br><br>

If some potential members of your team can’t participate in the review because they have a passionate point of view or a stake in your outcomes, you can involve them as stakeholders instead. Their feedback will give you a broader sense of the competing interests connected to your topic. <br><br>
