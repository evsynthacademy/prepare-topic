## What’s your perspective?

You might already have a topic and a few questions you want to answer for your systematic review. But before you go any further, be sure to dig a little deeper and consider why you care about this topic. What’s your motivation for conducting this review?

Take kidney failure as an example. Here are just four examples of how your perspective might shape the design of your research:

**Personal experience**<br>

Let’s say **your father** was just diagnosed with kidney failure. You might want to conduct a systematic review to learn everything you can about how his condition might affect him: what does the research say about how long patients typically live after they reach your father’s stage of kidney damage? How will this diagnosis affect his quality of life? What treatments work best for patients that are similar to your father?  

**Commercial interest**<br>

**A health insurance company** concerned with kidney failure might have a completely different set of concerns. Because health insurers pay to manage the health of a wide population of people, they might want to know which treatment approaches are most cost effective. They could also be interested in what circumstances make it most likely patients will comply with their treatment protocol. And for preventive care, they might seek more information about ways to catch and treat patients before they reach the stage of kidney failure. 

**Clinical decisions**<br>

**A doctor** researching kidney failure might have more clinical concerns: is it enough to diagnose kidney failure using a blood test paired with a mathematical formula or is it necessary to directly measure the patient’s Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)? How do new treatment approaches compare to the standard approaches for treating kidney failure? 

**Policy decisions**<br>

A politician or an employee of a government agency might be looking at broader issues: what are the major stumbling blocks to decreasing the rate of chronic kidney disease? How might changes in reimbursement rates encourage early intervention? What are effective models for improving coordination between primary care physicians and nephrologists?

As you can see, the same broad topic generates entirely different sets of questions for different types of people and organizations. 

On the next page, you’ll have a chance to write out your own set of motivations.
