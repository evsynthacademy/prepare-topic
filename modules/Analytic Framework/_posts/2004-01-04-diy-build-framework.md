##    Do it yourself: build an analytic framework

We could go into more detail about how to draw your analytic framework, but for the purposes of this course, it’s just important that you document your current thinking about how you’ll approach this research.  <br><br>
And don’t worry about being perfect- your analytic framework will evolve as you continue to refine your topic.
 <br><br>
Start by just identifying the basic elements in your framework:
 <br><br>
 
- **What population do you want to study?**
- **What intervention are you studying?**
- **What are your final outcomes?**
- **What are some intermediate outcomes that can help you make educated assumptions about your final outcomes?**

<br><br>

**Now, try drawing your analytic framework with these elements:**

Once your framework is finalized, you can use it to keep a handle on the scope of your systematic review and ultimately structure your final report.
