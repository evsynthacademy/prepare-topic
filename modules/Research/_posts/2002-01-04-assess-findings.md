**Are there tens of thousands of studies about your question?** That might be an indication that you need to narrow your focus.<br><br> 
**Is there a lack of research about your question?** If you can only find a few studies about your topic, your question might be too specific, or your area of interest might not be ready for a systematic review. Also, the results of your review may have limited value.   <br><br>
If you feel that your search indicates there’s enough evidence to move forward with your systematic review, and your question is specific enough, you’ll want to start building a team of people who can help you.
