##   Has Someone Already Done This?


It would be embarrassing, and an incredible waste of time, if you conducted a systematic review after someone else had already done the same research. For example, there are at least 20 systematic reviews studying whether the chemicals doctors use in imaging tests like MRIs and PET scans can lead to kidney damage.
<br>
<br>
Even if no one has addressed your specific question, you can learn a lot from systematic reviews that are related to your research interest.
<br>
<br>
That’s why you should always **check if your topic has already been addressed by a systematic review or if a similar systematic review is already underway.** 
<br>
<br>
Where do you look? Here are a few places:

- [PROSPERO](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/): A registry of planned, ongoing and completed systematic reviews. If you eventually conduct a review yourself, you can register your protocol here too.<br>

- [The Cochrane Collaboration](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cochranelibrary/search) : An international non-profit organization devoted to conducting systematic reviews and encouraging the use of evidence based medicine. You can search the Cochrane library for related systematic reviews. <br><br>

- [The DARE database](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/CRDWeb/):  The Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) offers access to 
    - Tens of thousands of  systematic reviews of health and social care interventions
    -Summaries of all Cochrane systematic reviews and protocols up to March 2015
    -Over 17,000 economic evaluations of health and social care interventions
    <br>
    <br>
    
The Department of Health and the National Institute for Health Research stopped funding this database in 2015, so DARE is no longer adding new records, but the archives will be available until at least 2021.<br><br>

- [PubMed Systematic Review Filter](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/researchers/pubmed-systematic-review-methods-filter/) : You might already use PubMed to search for academic studies, but did you know that PubMed has a filter to help you find systematic reviews? [Click here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/researchers/pubmed-systematic-review-methods-filter/) to learn more about how to use the filter. 
Ok, so you’ve looked for systematic reviews related to your topic and so far no one has addressed your specific area of interest. On the next page, we’ll talk about how to quickly survey the existing research about your topic to determine whether there is enough evidence to start your own systematic review.
