##    Survey existing research

When you start your systematic review, you’ll conduct a very comprehensive search of research related to your topic. But for now, you just want to gather a general sense of how your topic has been studied and if there’s enough evidence for a full scale review. 
<br>
<br>

To do this, conduct searches in electronic databases related to your area of interest. In addition to the databases mentioned in our previous section on searching for systematic reviews, here are a few other resources to try:
<br>
<br>

- [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) will give you a good sense of the existing biomedical literature about your topic.<br><br>
- [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/schhp?hl=en&as_sdt=0,40) is a free, user friendly search engine for finding peer reviewed, scientific materials and a good source for the full text of some articles.
